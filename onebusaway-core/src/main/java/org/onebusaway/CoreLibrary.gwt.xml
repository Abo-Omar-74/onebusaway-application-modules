    <!--
        This is a GWT module descriptor that makes it possible to include a number of key classes from the
        onebusaway-core module in GWT applications. Specifically, classes in the org.onebusaway.exceptions and
        org.onebusaway.utility.collections packages are included. This necessarily the restricts the set of JVM classes
        that can be referenced by these target classes as defined by the GWT compiler.
